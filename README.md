*This is a snippet from the script we used in the production environment to generate our assets and metadata. 
We'll be fixing up the script further and opensource the full tool down the line for the community to use in their own projects / to fork and improve upon :)*

**Instructions**
 1. Ensure [GOLang](https://go.dev/) is installed and upto date
 2. Clone the repository and CD to the cloned directory
 3. Run `go build` and execute the binary that was generated
 4. Check the output folder once execution is complete and you can verify that all the assets match up!
